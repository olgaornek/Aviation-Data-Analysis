# Aviation-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on leveraging aviation data to simulate how an airline or airport authority can extract actionable insights using big data tools. 

## Business Overview
The airline industry operates on a fast-paced, data-driven environment where efficiency and real-time decision-making are crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction and profitability. Airlines must monitor various Key Perfomance Indicators (KPIs) such as flight volumn, on-time performance, and route efficiency to optimize operations. This project focus on leveraging aviation data to simulate how an airline or airport authority can extract actionable insights using big data tools. By utilizing flight information from the AviationStack API and processing it through Databricks, this project aims to showcase how real-time data can support smarter scheduling, route planning, and performance analysis across airline networks.
